        <h2>Brayden McAllister</h2>
        <h2>But you can call me Brayden</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Brayden. I am studying computer science and my goal is to become a software engineer. 
            I like to outdoor, gaming, reading, and sports. 
            From this course I hope gain a better understand of websites, how they are made, and figure out if I would like to continue into the web development field. 
            I have been a member of The Church all my life. I just recently returned from a mission in Barranquilla Colombia and yes I do speak spanish. 
            I am always down to speak spanish if anyone wants to practice. 
        </p>
        <p>My favorite scripture is Ether 12:27 that say "And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. 
            I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; 
            for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them." 
            I like this scripture as it is a promise and a reminder that we can do hard things so long as we have faith and humble ourselves before God.</p>
