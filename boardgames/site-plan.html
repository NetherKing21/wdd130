      <h3>Strategies</h3>
      <h4>Monopoly</h4>
      <p>
        Winning Monopoly requires a combination of strategy and negotiation skills. To improve your chances of victory:
        Property Acquisition: Focus on obtaining property sets, especially the cheaper ones early in the game. Build houses and eventually hotels to increase rent.
        Monopolies: Aim to monopolize property groups. Owning all properties within a color group increases rent significantly.
        Trading: Negotiate with other players to complete property sets or acquire valuable properties. Seek mutually beneficial deals, but don't make trades that could create a monopoly for your opponents.
        Cash Management: Keep a reserve of cash for unforeseen expenses, like landing on an opponent's expensive property. Avoid overspending on properties you can't develop right away.
        Jail Strategy: Don't rush out of jail. Staying in jail can save you from landing on opponents' developed properties. Only pay to get out if your chances of landing on a harmful square are high.
      </p>
      <h4>Settlers of Catan</h4>
      <p>
        In Settlers of Catan, winning depends on careful resource management and strategic expansion:
        Resource Diversity: Aim for diverse resource hexes to ensure a steady supply of resources. Avoid overemphasizing a single resource type.
        Build Roads Early: Establish road networks to reach new settlement locations and control important resource hexes.
        Longest Road: Pursue the Longest Road bonus points, as it can be a game-changer. Keep an eye on what your opponents are doing and thwart their road-building efforts.
        Trading: Trade strategically with other players, making fair deals when it benefits you. Don't hesitate to negotiate for the resources you need.
        City Development: Upgrading settlements to cities increases your resource output, and obtaining two-to-one ports can further enhance your trading capabilities.
        Development Cards: Invest in development cards, as they can provide the largest point swings with victory points or the Largest Army bonus.
      </p>
      <h4>Star Realms</h4>
      <p>
        Star Realms is a deck-building game, and winning involves building an efficient deck:
        Card Selection: Focus on acquiring cards that complement your existing deck. Look for synergy between faction abilities.
        Trade and Combat Balance: Strike a balance between trade (acquiring cards) and combat (attacking your opponent's bases). Don't neglect defense.
        Outpost Priority: Prioritize bases and outposts with high defense values to protect yourself and generate trade.
        Scrapping: Use cards with the "scrap" ability to thin out your deck, making it more efficient.
        Economy: Increase your trade production through bases, and acquire bases with card draw abilities to keep your hand full.
      </p>
      <h4>Monoply Deal</h4>
      <p>
        Monopoly Deal is a card game that relies on a mix of luck and strategy:
        Property Sets: Concentrate on completing property sets as soon as possible. These sets are your main source of points.
        Rent Cards: Collect and use rent cards strategically. Save them for the right moment, such as when an opponent has a valuable set of properties.
        Action Cards: Use action cards wisely. Stealing properties, charging rent, and breaking up opponents' sets are all valuable actions.
        Resource Management: Carefully manage your hand to ensure you always have options. Discard or use less valuable cards when necessary.
        Bluffing: Consider bluffing by holding cards face down. Your opponents won't know whether you're hoarding valuable properties or simply bluffing to confuse them.
      </p>
      <h4>Here to Slay</h4>
      <p>
        Here to Slay combines strategy and whimsy, with an emphasis on defeating monsters:
        Party Composition: Assemble a balanced party with different character abilities that complement one another. Having a mix of offensive and defensive abilities is key.
        Resource Management: Manage your resources (represented by cards) carefully. Don't waste actions on irrelevant monsters or abilities.
        Monster Selection: Target monsters that align with your party's strengths. Consider the rewards and penalties associated with each monster type.
        Character Abilities: Utilize character abilities strategically to gain advantages in battles or protect your party.
        Timing: Choose when to attack, defend, and deploy character abilities to maximize your chances of defeating monsters and gaining victory points.
      </p>
      <h4>Secret Hitler</h4>
      <p>
        Winning Secret Hitler involves both deduction and persuasion:
        Information Gathering: Pay close attention to players' actions and voting patterns. Look for inconsistencies and suspicious behavior.
        Team Building: If you are a Liberal, work on forming a team of trusted players. If you are a Fascist, be subtle in building trust and forming alliances with other Fascists.
        Bluffing and Deception: As a Fascist, sow confusion and cast doubt on the Liberals. As a Liberal, subtly accuse the Fascists without being overly aggressive.
        Hitler's Identity: Fascists must protect Hitler's identity and keep them from being elected as Chancellor.
        Policy Play: As Chancellor, consider the implications of the policies you enact and how it affects your team's chances of winning. As President, choose the right Chancellor who will help your side.
        Final Election: If the Liberals have enough policies enacted, focus on electing a Liberal government to win. If you're a Fascist, aim to elect a Fascist government without revealing Hitler's identity.
